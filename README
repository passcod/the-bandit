— Arr, yarr, so I was hurtlin' through the outback in this piece of junk
  when my crystals fell apart, so I got out an' gave'm a proper burial.
  But y'know, maybe I shouldn't have 'cause I think I'd rather've saved
  my water for my poor throat, heh.

— You still made it alive, though.

— Aah, yes, that I did. Found meself a corpse, gave me the fright o' my
  life, but poor guy hadn't drunk all of his flask when he croaked. I
  say, I buried more souls on this once than I ever did before. Perhaps
  this is what saved me, if you don't mind me saying...

— There's no ears here.

— ...oh that's good to hear, but y'can never be too prudent. Err, enough
  'bout me, I'm justa old drunkard now, the world is passing me by. It's
  not my time anymore, huh. So what'sa young'un like ya doin' here, if
  ya don't mind me asking?

— I'm just a student.

— Justa? Just? Ahrr, keep at it, you'll become something. Not like me. Oh
  for all our drunk sakes promise me... arr, promise... that's ya'll never
  be like meself, kay?

— Don't you worry, gramps. Philip! I'll settle his tab.

— You're too generous kid. Be safe out there.


He got up, paid both accounts and walked calmly out the door. I waited a
full minute before going up to the bar and asking:

— Excuse me, but who was that young man? I mean, I don't–

— Don't worry. Everybody asks the first time. I don't know what it is,
  but that kid's something else. Everyone here finds him a little odd,
  nobody knows what's up, though. He came in one day just after I'd
  opened up, sat down at that same table you were at, and stayed the
  night.

A small woman piped up:

— I remember! I came in and out five times that night, and he didn't
  move an inch. Barely touched his drink either. It wasn't until...

A shabby suit interrupted.

— No, he did come up once before that. On a dark night, with no moon.

— Ah, stop it with your stories, Arthur. As I was saying, it wasn't
  until Max passed that he came to sit at the bar.

— May he rest in peace.

Before I'd noticed, everyone in the small room had come together around
me, trying to speak up and say what they had. The barman –Philip– cast
his eyes around, and gruffly instructed everyone away and back to their
space.

— You're smothering the poor thing! Shoo!

I opened my mouth but he continued:

— The kid comes in nearly every day. Come again and talk to him, would
  you? He hardly gets to speak to people his age, here. And finish your
  drink; it's on the house.

The following day I came into the bar as early as I could. Philip raised
an eyebrow but made no comment. I got a pint and sat down. As people sat,
drank, talked, left, paid, drank again... I observed everything through
half-closed eyes. The half tones, the faded sunlight. The dusty rays of
brightness from the lone skylight. Dark shapes moving about. The strange
dance of alcohol poured and mixed and shaken and served. The intriguing
creaking of the wood and steel in the boards and ceiling. That was nothing
out of the ordinary, for the average out-in-the-old-burbs bar – at least,
on the surface. However, there was a distinctive feel about the place, an
imperceptible unease, something only very slightly offsetting, that one
couldn't quite place. I think the regulars came for that very same thing:
perhaps even in hope that by staying there they might discover the source
of the trouble. Thus the place had made its reputation. “They go there for
the small excitement of a new experience, but whether one stays or not is
a measure of their curiosity, whatever they may say.” The words were from
a man who was convinced the next big story would come from there. His tip
had fazed neither I nor the rest of the journalists whom he had spoken to;
besides, it wasn't for this reason I had come here.

As the sun bore down lower on the horizon, there were a few times I nearly
got up and left, gave up on waiting. But somehow Patrick knew that, and kept
me occupied until I decided to stay for a while again. He told me and had
some of the regular tell me of various tall tales, which none but the drunk
would believe, and they all knew it, but they kept telling them, and laughing
at the parts that were even more ridiculous than the tales themselves. The
atmosphere seemed to be shifting from cheery to grim to euphoric to sad to
content again, and as the light shone brighter and the sky became darker, the
drunkedness increased, if only ever so slightly. I had been drinking something
completely new to me, a particularly strong yet incredibly sweet alcohol, which
could only – according to the patrons – be drunk straight by either fools or madmen.
I myself contended with lapping it up a few mils at a time, and by the time the
sun set I had reached only just under the halfway mark.

And I looked at the door. And the door was closed. And the door was open. And
it was closed again. The young man walked through and sat next to me, nodded
once in the direction of my drink, and sighed. I stuttered a greeting. He did
not even blink. When his drink as done – the same as mine – he turned to me and
smiled:

— You want to know who I am.

— Yes.

— I cannot say anything here. But if you wish to take a leap of faith, you may
  join me someone more private. However, I will not leave this seat for the night.
  Hence you have to choose: are you a fool to men for trusting me, or are you one
  of them madmen?

He took his glass and downed it straight. And, after only a moment's hesitation, I
did the same with my remaining half. The disconfort was immediate. The liquor instantly
disabled most of my senses, and left my brain whirring along for an interminably long
second. Had I been in a novel, perhaps, my life would have flashed before my eyes and
I would have been terrified of what might come next, unsure of anything. But this was
real life, and my brain did what it did best in these situations: it became fixated on
the only thing I possibly didn't wish to think of right now: whether or now, that very
morning, I had put my grey socks in the washing, insignificance which seemed the only
obstacle between me and ethanol-fueled nirvana. I cringed. Wait– I cringed?

I looked around to discover the bar gone and its patrons vanished.

— Drat! Now I've gone crazy.

— Precisely.

The voice had come from nowhere. In fact, I was nowhere.

— Not exactly. You're inside my head.

— You mean /my/ head, right? I'm talking to the voice in my head because I've gone
  crazy, and this is even crazier, oh oh I should shut up.

— Would this make it any easier?

I blinked: I was now sitting on a bench, in what looked suspiciously like a painting
of a park I had once seen at school. At the far end, beyond a bouquet of young trees,
was a single gondola floating on clear water.

— The Lone Gondola. A painting by an unknown artist, found over 500 years ago during
  a raid on a then-famous art thief's collection, and authenticated to be many several
  millenia older than that. The oldest painting in the world, it is said, yet no one
  knows how it was painted...

— ...the technology at the time wasn't advanced enough, and the scene it represents is
  unheard of existing at the time. I learned this at school. It's one of the great
  mysteries of the world. And we are in the painting?

— No. This is merely a projection. I have tried to reconstruct the scene as faithfully
  as possible, but there are a few minor kinks and off-place details. You are, indeed,
  inside my head. I used the stupor induced by the liquor to bypass your innate mental
  defenses and invite you in. You might have taken a class on the subject. If you have,
  you will know that there is no way for me to project an image of myself to act as my
  avatar; and while I could project another figure instead, I prefer to just stay thus
  and speak without body nor shade. It's a bit easier, if you will.

— I have taken it, or rather, I am taking at the moment. But, just previously, you...
  read my mind, didn't you?

— Again, not quite. While your inner thoughts happen within your mind, outer thoughts
  are merely contained whispers. Out in the world, to listen in to these requires one
  to cast a line near your mind... and capture the signal. In this no-space, though,
  both outer thoughts and speech are wide open. In fact, what you are hearing right
  this moment are more like outer thoughts than speech. There's so little distinction
  it would be meaningless to use one over the other predominantly.
  
  But: you didn't come here to be lectured on inter-mind messaging principles. I believe
  you have a few questions for me. Don't you?

I didn't answer, but instead got up and walked to the gondola. I remembered spending
long hours staring at the painting, at its almost magical beauty – or maybe really
magical, as a millenia-old painting could not possibly have survived by simply being...
could it? The question was not one worth pursuing by myself, as countless scholars, much
more experienced than myself, were always coming to grips about their various conjectures.
As school-children, we contented ourselves with the more exciting yet simplistic ones: was
the painting proof of an earlier advanced civilisation? of time travel? of aliens? Yet,
beyond the squabble, I remember a small question in my mind: what was painted on the other
side of the small craft? On the visible side, there was a small, stylised sun. Was there
a moon on the reverse? Another sun? Or maybe nothing? I went through the possibilities.
The question was so insignificant that it stuck in my mind throughout the years. In art
class one year, I painted suns like the one in the painting everywhere. I was crazed, by
something very different to the incessant worries of kids my age. And now I was /in/ a
projection of that painting! What would I see if I looked at the other side now?

A white rose. It was a white rose. Something I had never thought of. But I was in a
projection, so... I frowned.

— That white rose. Is it mine or yours?

There was no answer, if only a faint chuckle. I reiterated. Again and again. And finally:
‘Neither.’ Neither? Then whose? But try as I might, I couldn't get another word out. So
I walked back to the bench and asked the question I had originally come here for:

— Who are you?

He spoke, but the sounds were foreign to my ear. And suddenly, I was at the bar again,
a concerned young man looking up at me. I realised I was standing. As I sat back down
he asked:

— What did I say?

And, again, to my confused expression:

— In /nazel/, what did I say?

— Nazel? Is that the language you spoke?

— No. Well, yes. /Nazel/ is the word in that language for the ‘dream sleep’: the state of
  mind we were just in. I do not know the name of the language, I do not even know many
  of its words. What I do know is that whenever someone asks who I am in nazel, they hear
  me speaking but I do not.

— You don't? But, why would it matter? You do know who... oh. You do not know who you
  are? Then, why...

— I might not know who I really am, but it doesn't mean I do not know I am at the moment.
  It's been a while. But something happened tonight: you asked another question. And even
  if I didn't answer back then, it was only to avoid further delay. Do you want to know?

— Whether the white rose was yours or mine? Or rather, why you answered as you did? Yes,
  if you please, yes.

— Very well. The white rose is neither mine nor yours, because there really was a white
  rose on the other side of that gandola. I know, because I painted that scene. Don't
  looked too shocked, please, it would worry Patrick, and I do not wish the burden of
  knowledge on unsuspecting people. I am the painter. I am, indeed, eons old. But I've
  kept rather nicely, don't you think?

It's been three days now that I'm alone so I decided to keep a diary.
Just to pass the time, y'know. It reminds me of Meia.

She's probably dead, now, along with everyone else. I don't even know
why I'm writing this. I think it's because I'm lonely. There's nobody
else, there's nothing else, it's me and the cargo ship. It's quite
ridiculous really, we're near Alice Flats, it's supposed to be desert
and sand and rocks for hundreds of Ks, but no. There's me on a cargo
ship full of canned food and we're standing still on vitrified ground.
It's horrible. Small consolation: they didn't use old atomics, so there's
no radiation. I'm safe. And alone. And I don't know why we survived. We?
See, I'm already going crazy: I'm talking about the cargo ship and me as we.

I wish I'd have gone out with Eddy last month. That way I might have had a
boyfriend and we might have been three (with the cargo ship), stuck in the
middle of nowhere. Or we might have been vitrified while making out. I can't
even decide which would have been better. Fortunately my chances of dying are
pretty slim right now. Suicide is not an option, you understand, don't you?
Dammit. Now we're three: the cargo ship, my diary, and me. So, suicide; there's
that little part of me that says it might be better, to die and not have to
worry about things and not have to write that stupid diary. No offence. But
everytime I think that, my gut hurts, my chest aches, and I feel like crying:
because I don't want to die.

I'm Emily, by the way. I'm Emily and I don't want to die.

Day 4:

Nothing else happened.


Day 5:

Still nothin.


Day 6:

...


Day 7:

Nope.


Day 8:



Day 17:

The ground is still too hot so I can't explore much. Every morning I test it by
tearing off the paper wrappings from a can and dropping it overboard. And every
morning since... the paper bursts into flames when it reaches the ground (or
maybe even before that – I'm quite high up so I can't see the details). Additionally,
it gets hotter and hotter as I go down into the depths of the ship. I have no idea
when (or if, but I am determined to stay positive) this place will cool down enough
for me to step out. I am starting to feel claustrophobic, here on this massive, empty
boat. I'll only write if something happens... so if these are my last words, please
find my body and take it away from this place. Please.

— Oh, and by the way, the name's Jane.

He had just declared himself to be a man beyond any reckoning, had just displayed a
facility and proficiency with advanced mind techniques, had just revealed that he had
painted /the/ painting… and yet he kept chit-chatting as if nothing had happened!

— Well, to me, it's not really too out of the ordinary, y'know.

— Wh– I thought you said you couldn't read my mind!

— I can't. It's just written all over your face.

He was looking somewhat amused.

— Now, let's see… would you mind telling me yours?

— Huh?

— Thy name, fair Lady. Doeth-thou please to give it up hence?

— Oh. Oh. Ah. Uh. Stop chuckling! Sorry. I– it's not– I. Ah. My-name-is-Emily-
  is-it-really-true-how-can-do-you-have-proof-do-I-even-want-to-know-why-me?

– Well. Let's see: Nice-to-meet-you-yes-it-is-I-can-I-do-that's-your-choice-you
  -seemed-nice-and-your-ki-feels-trustworthy.

He seemed to be enjoying himself thouroughly, a notion I found absolutely terrifying
for some reason.

— My ki /feels/ trustworthy?

— Yes. Ki, or aura, or spirit, or chakra, or any other name that's been given to it.
  It's all the same thing. I like ‘ki’ as it's short and to-the-point, but you can
  substitute your preference. It's really just another kind of energy. What is commonly
  called ‘magic’ is a specific protocol, a set of rules that govern the use of this
  energy. But beneath the protocol, there's something sometimes called /taint/: this
  is what I mean when I say your ki feels trustworthy. Taint is a generalisation of
  your particular ki signature.

— By signature, you mean how someone's magic is unique?

— Yes. The ki your body generates has various characteristics. Quantity, quality,
  seasonal and diurnal fluctuations, jitter, frequency, polarisation, purity… there's
  a lot more, depending on how deep or complex you want to get. Generally, most of these
  are fixed at certain levels, and the set of all these characteristics forms your ki
  signature. It can change, most often unconsciously when something in you changes,
  although it is possible to modify your own signature yourself. It's very difficult and
  carries a lot of risk, but it's possible.

— And taint is a generalisation… I don't get it.

— Simply put, the ki signatures of people can be closely related to their personalities
  and heart and what have you. I'm not implying causation here, simply correlation based
  on my own experience. When I look at you ki, its particular pattern resembles those of
  my other people, and it so happens most of these were trustworthy. I just followed the
  trend and took my chances. Given the large amount of people I've delt with, I rarely
  make a mistake that way.

— But you have made mistakes?

— Sometimes.
